# MeetingInvites
This is a smple application where a user is prompted to fill in his/her details in order to confirm attendence of the general meeting. I demonstrate how to use ASP.NET Web API to add an HTTP web service to an MVC framework application and consume the web service in the browser.
I also created the client side functionality that consumes the web service.  The single HTML document created is requested by the browser and then manipulated and populated
using Javascript and data obtained via Ajax requests.I used Postman to test to test the web service.
